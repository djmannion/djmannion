**Hi, I'm Damien.**

I'm interested in science, research, education, and technology.

My background is in research in the area of perception (vision and hearing; [more information about my research](https://www.djmannion.net/pubs)) and in teaching perception and research skills.
I have a particular interest in the development of computational skills in researchers, and I have created resources such as ["Programming for psychology in Python"](https://www.djmannion.net/psych_programming) and ["Fundamentals of data and coding for psychology"](https://webutils.psy.unsw.edu.au/internship_coding/site/).
I also enjoy using the functionality of the modern web to create interactive instructional material, such as an [image Fourier analysis explorer](https://www.djmannion.net/img_freq_web_post/), a [simulator of visually-responsive neurons](https://www.djmannion.net/neural_sim/), and an [explorer for spectral distributions in a visual scene](https://webutils.psy.unsw.edu.au/psyc2071_2020/colour/cmp_spectral/colour_cmp_spectral.html).

Technology-wise, I use Python for pretty much everything&mdash;except for web-based projects, where I use JavaScript (recently via TypeScript, using Deno).
Recently, I have been particularly enjoying using [`xarray`](https://docs.xarray.dev) for structured data representation and storage.
I am also a fan of [`veusz`](https://veusz.github.io/) for creating figures, [`pymc`](https://docs.pymc.io/) for Bayesian analyses, and [Code Ocean](https://codeocean.com) for producing reproducible analysis workflows.
I am a long-time Linux user and like using simple interfaces.

Personally, I enjoy [running](https://en-gb.smashrun.com/damienmannion) and usually get out for a run a few times a week.
I&rsquo;ve run a few marathons in the past&nbsp;(slowly) but I&rsquo;m not currently training for anything in particular&mdash;mostly trying to improve my [parkrun](https://www.parkrun.com/)&nbsp;(5 km) [times](https://www.parkrun.com.au/results/athleteresultshistory/?athleteNumber=4072605).

I occasionally write posts on various topics:
