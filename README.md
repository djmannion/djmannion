Hi, I'm Damien.

I'm interested in science, research, education, and technology.

My background is in [research](https://www.djmannion.net/pubs/) in the area of perception (vision and hearing) and in teaching perception and research skills.
I have a particular interest in the development of computational skills in researchers, and I have created resources such as ["Programming for psychology in Python"](https://www.djmannion.net/psych_programming) and ["Fundamentals of data and coding for psychology"](https://webutils.psy.unsw.edu.au/internship_coding/site/).
I also enjoy using the functionality of the modern web to create interactive instructional material, such as an [image Fourier analysis explorer](https://www.djmannion.net/img_freq_web_post/), a [visually-responsive neuron simulator](https://www.djmannion.net/neural_sim/), and an [explorer for spectral distributions in a visual scene](https://webutils.psy.unsw.edu.au/psyc2071_2020/colour/cmp_spectral/colour_cmp_spectral.html).

I occasionally write posts on various topics:
* [Using containers for reproducible and collaborative computation](https://www.djmannion.net/containers/)
* [An interactive image Fourier analysis website](https://www.djmannion.net/img_freq_web_post/)
* [A web version of an interactive visual neuron simulator](https://www.djmannion.net/neural_sim/)
* [Rendering stimuli for perception studies using Mitsuba 2](https://www.djmannion.net/mitsuba_render/)
* [Motion-defined surfaces and surface lightness](https://www.djmannion.net/mdc_lightness/)
* [Code review as part of a research workflow](https://www.djmannion.net/code_review/)
