**Hi, I'm Damien.**

I'm interested in research, computing, science, education, and technology.

I work as a Senior Research Data Specialist in the [Melbourne Data Analytics Platform](https://www.unimelb.edu.au/mdap) at the [University of Melbourne](https://www.unimelb.edu.au) in Australia.
My background is in research in the area of perception (vision and hearing; [more information about my research](https://www.djmannion.net/pubs)) and in teaching perception and research skills.
Personally, I enjoy [running](https://www.strava.com/athletes/110970834) and usually get out for a run a few times a week.

I occasionally write posts on various topics:
* [Python disrememberings](https://www.djmannion.net/python_disrememberings/)
* [Using custom data types in Python: reflections on the use of type hints](https://www.djmannion.net/python_typing_ppant/)
